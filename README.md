Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Authentication: Firebase Auth Hosting: Frontend, Backend

Why This Project: I chose this project because pet names are often either too basic or too serious—this aims to change that with maximum absurdity. It’s a fun way to explore authentication, database interactions, and user-generated content while ensuring every pet has a truly unique (and ridiculous) identity.
